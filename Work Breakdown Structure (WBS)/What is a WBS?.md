## The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical description of the work that must be done to complete the deliverables of a project. 
### Each descending level in the WBS represents an increasingly detailed description of the project deliverables.
### The development of Work Breakdown Structure involves subdividing the major project activities or sub-activities into smaller, more manageable activities until the activities are defined in sufficient detail to support the management and development of project works. 
### There are usually 3 types of WBS: <br/>
-> Noun-based <br/>
-> Verb-based <br/> 
-> Time-based <br/>
