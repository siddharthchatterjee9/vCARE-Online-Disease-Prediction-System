## A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a traditional way to visualize the information flows within a system. 
## A neat and clear DFD can depict a good amount of the system requirements graphically. It can be manual, automated, or a combination of both.
## It usually begins with a context diagram as level 0 of the DFD diagram, a simple representation of the whole system. 
## To elaborate further from that, we drill down to a level 1 diagram with lower-level functions decomposed from the major functions of the system. 
## This could continue to evolve to become a level 2 diagram when further analysis is required. 
### A few diagram notations are: <br />
1. External entity
2. Process
3. Data Store
4. Data Flow
### Rules:
1. Data flow cannot connect entities or data store together.
2. Number each repeated entity.
3. Label each process and flow.
