## A class diagram in UML is a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects.
### Purpose of Class Diagrams:
1. Shows static structure of classifiers in a system
2. Diagram provides a basic notation for other structure diagrams prescribed by UML
3. Helpful for developers and other team members too
4. Business Analysts can use class diagrams to model systems from a business perspective
### A class notation consists of three parts:
1. Class Name: <br />
    -> The name of the class appears in the first partition.
2. Class Attributes: <br />
    -> Attributes are shown in the second partition. <br />
    -> The attribute type is shown after the colon. <br />
    -> Attributes map onto member variables (data members) in code. 
3. Class Operations(Methods): <br />
    -> Operations are shown in the third partition. They are services the class provides. <br />
    -> The return type of a method is shown after the colon at the end of the method signature. <br />
    -> The return type of method parameters is shown after the colon following the parameter name. <br />
    -> Operations map onto class methods in code.
### Relationship type can be Inheritance, Simple Association, Generalization, Aggregation, Composition or Dependency.
